# Starting Repo
This version uses React, Redux, Express,  and PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).

I **STRONGLY** recommend following these instructions carefully. It's a lot, and will take some time to set up, but your life will be much easier this way in the long run.

## Use the Template for This Repository (Don't Clone)

- Don't Fork or Clone. Instead, click the `Use this Template` button, and make a copy to your personal account.


## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `database-name` and create tables e.g a `user` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);
```

If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `database-name` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`

## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project 
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Debugging

To debug, you will need to run the client-side separately from the server. Start the client by running the command `npm run client`. Start the debugging server by selecting the Debug button.

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:5000`

Directory Structure:

- `src/` contains the React application
- `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
- `build/` after you build the project, contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site
- `server/` contains the Express App
